## Safety & Child-proofing
* Dangling cords, hot liquids, tablecloths, appliances, plastic bags, electrical outlets, and stairs can all be dangerous to an exploring/curious baby.
* Keep household cleaners, vitamins, and medicines out of reach.
* Keep your baby safe with constant supervision during bath time and when on high surfaces such as changing tables, beds, and sofas.
* Avoid walkers. They can tip over and cause your baby harm.
* Be careful of small objects and powder: babies can choke on them. Small magnets and batteries, when swallowed, can cause serous internal injuries.
* Install the car seat in the back seat, rear-facing.
* Check to make sure smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are working.
* Avoid smoke/tobacco/cigarette/vaping liquid or smoke/marijuana exposure.
* Consider learning infant/child CPR.

## Development
* Your assertive baby is on the move. Your baby can sit and play, but may also be scooting/crawling, pulling up to a stand, and "cruising".
* Your child can pick up small objects between their thumb and index finger (pincer grasp).
* Pushing buttons and rolling balls help figure out how things work.
* Activities/books/songs/rhymes with repetition are fun, predictable, and help to build memory.
* Your baby can imitate speech by babbling consonant sounds ("bababa" or "datada") and actions such as waving "bye-bye". You can help your baby "speaking" by providing words for her emotions and pictures/objects your child is interested in.
* Your baby understands that things still exist even if they cannot see them making "hide-and-seek" more run, and "good-byes" even harder. Remember, never sneak out. Your babies awareness may cause them to be clingy with their caregivers and more fearful with strangers. Providing comfort is soothing, not "spoiling".
* Face-to-face interaction with caregivers and avoiding screen time, except for live video chatting with loved ones, will enhance your child's social and verbal development.

## Family Well-being
* Nine month olds are developing opinions, strong feelings, and expectations that can lead to frustration and upset. Sometimes infants can be calmed by distraction, sometimes they need to be held, or sometimes talking to them calmly can help. This is normal, though can be exhausting for caregivers. It is OK to take time for yourself.
* Consider letting your baby stay with someone you trust in order to find time for yourself or to reconnect with your partner/friends.

## Infant Care
** Acetaminophen and ibuprofen can help with fever and signs of discomfort.
** Teething rings, a cool washcloth, or a clean finger can be used to baby's gums during times of teething discomfort. Brush teeth twice daily with fluoride toothpaste the size of a grain of rice on a soft toothbrush or clean finger. Avoid teething products with benzocaine.
** It is safe to take your baby outdoors if they are dressed appropriately and protected from the weather. Be cautious about exposing your baby to crowds or to people who may be sick.
** Use sunscreen (SPF 15 or higher).
** Saline drops can be used for nasal congestion, which is common in infants.

## Sleep
* Simple, calming, bedtime routines can help prepare your baby for bedtime. Try to recognize signs that your baby is getting tired.
* Help your baby learn how to fall asleep on their own by putting them down when they are drowsy, but not fully asleep. Expect a protest if this is a new change for your child.
* Some babies establish a pattern of naps with long stretches of sleep, but others are fine taking shorter naps or napping at less regular times. Recognizing patterns and create a nap ritual can be helpful. Nap patterns will change as your baby grows and develops.
* Anticipate sleep disruption as part of normal development.
* A favorite stuffed animal may help your baby feel more secure.

## Nutrition
* Your baby is transitioning from breast milk and formula to solids as the main source of nutrition and calories.
* Give Vitamin D (400IU/day) to babies receiving break milk.
* Continue simple routines including 3 meals (fruits, veggies, meats/proteins, grains) a day. Meals are opportunities to spend time together as a family.
* Your baby may be ready for more thickness and lumpiness of their food. Your child may also be ready to feed themselves with your support.
* Finger foods are bit size, easy to pick up, and squish between fingers. Avoid foods that may cause choking.
* Let your baby decide how much food to have and how fast/slow to eat it. Give your baby time to pause, rest, socialize, and go back to eating. Talking in a relaxed/encouraging manner helps you and your baby feel calm. It is normal for feedings to be messy.
* Offer a cup without "no-spill valve". Your baby does not need juice, tea, or flavored drinks. **Avoid honey.**
