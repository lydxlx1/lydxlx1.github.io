Helpful tips for this state of life. 
## Family Well-being

* Caregiver feelings of highs and lows are normal. If these “baby blues” are overwhelming or last for more than a few days, please talk with someone you trust (including your doctor).
* Find the support you need to help take care of yourself and your baby.
* Speak up when you down. You can call WA State Postpartum Support at 1-888-404-7763.

## Nutrition

* Use breast milk or formula only.
* Give Vitamin D (400 IU/day) to babies receiving breast milk.
* Trust your instinct when feeding your baby. Hunger cues may include opening and closing the mouth, sucking on hands, smacking lips, turning the head toward your breast, acting fussy or looking unhappy. Signs of being full may include turning the head away, closing the mouth, losing interest, or falling asleep.
* Breast fed babies can learn to take a bottle at this age.
* Spitting up is common. Keeping your baby upright after feeds can help. Ask your doctor if you have concerns about associated pain, choking, or feeding problems.
* Do not give your baby extra water.

## Development

* Babies prefer human stimuli (a face, voice, touch, smell) over anything else.
* Watch for your baby’s cues, including turning away or crying when she needs a break.
* Babies feel deep emotions, but lack the skills to regulate the intensity or duration of those emotions. Provide responsive and nurturing care to help your baby feel secure. This is not “spoiling” your baby.
* [Tummy time](https://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/week-13/tummy-time.aspx) and gentle activities that allow your baby to “track” objects/people can help strengthen neck muscles. Gentle massage can be introduced to share a quiet, calming time with your baby.

## Newborn Care

* For babies 3 months or younger, a fever can be serious. Call us if your baby has a temperature of 100.4°F/38.0°C or higher.
* It is safe to take your baby outdoors if they are dressed appropriately and protected from the weather. Be cautious about exposing your baby to crowds or to people who may be sick.
* Caregivers can further protect their baby by updating their own vaccinations, especially the TDAP (whooping cough vaccine), MMR, and seasonal flu vaccine.
* Saline drops can be used for nasal congestion, which is common in newborns.

## Safety

* Put your baby to sleep on their back. Sleep positioners are not safe for babies.
* Install the car seat in the backseat, rear-facing.
* Check to make sure smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are working.
* Avoid smoke/tobacco/cigarette/vaping liquid or smoke/marijuana exposure.
* Avoid hot liquids around your baby and set your water temperature to < 120°F (48.9°C) to prevent accidental burns.
* Provide constant supervision when your baby is around pets or siblings.
* **Never shake your baby.** When you are feeling overwhelmed, take a break and ask for help.

## Crying

* Crying is normal way babies communicate hunger, discomfort, distress, or a need to connect with you.
* When we respond to babies quickly and sensitively, over time, they tend to cry less. They learn that care is coming.
* As your baby becomes more alert, they will begin to cry more. This is normal. Some babies cry much more than others and sometimes it can feel as if nothing works. Just by being with your baby, they learn that they can trust and rely on you. Trust yourself and reach out when you need support.

## Overseas Travel

If you will be traveling with you family overseas, talk with your doctor about travel questions, or you can request an online pre-travel health consultation through out eTravel Clinic.
