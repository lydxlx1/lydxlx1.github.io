Normally, you see the following dialog box when copying files from one folder to another and hitting a conflict.

There are three options:
- Keep Both
- Stop
- Replace

But what if you want to SKIP duplicated files and still copy the remaining new files?
The trick is the "option" key. When pressed, the "Keep Both" button will replaced with "Skip"!

Lastly, here are some fun facts:
- The icon of the "option" key is a circuit switch, indicating that you can choose either options.
- The "option" key is also useful to remove the boarder in taking screenshots.
- Mac seems to be clever enough to remember my previous decision as now "Skip" is shown by default and "Keep Both" becomes the hidden one once "option" key is pressed.
