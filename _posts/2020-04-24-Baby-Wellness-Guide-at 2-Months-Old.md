Helpful tips for this state of life.

## Infant Care
- For babies 3 month or younger, a fever can be serious.
  Call us if your baby has a temperature of 100.4 F / 38.0 C or higher.
- It is safe to take your baby outdoors if they are dressed appropriately and protected from the weather.
  Be cautious about exposing your baby to crowds or to people who may be sick.
- Caregivers can further protect their baby by updating their own vaccinations, especially the Tdap (whooping cough vaccine), MMR, and seasonal flu vaccine.
- Saline drops and suction can be used for nasal congestion, which is common in infants.

## Family Well-being
- Simple routines and schedules can give you and your baby a sense of confidence regarding expectations during your day.
- Try to find moments in your day to care for yourself in a healthy way.
  When you are calm and relaxed, your baby is also more likely to feel calm.
- Ask for help from trusted family and friends so you can get a break yourself.
- Finding nurturing and safe childcare can help you feel more comfortable during the times you might need to be away from your baby.

## Development
- Your baby is recognizing and responding to caregivers, and enjoys smiling at you and seeing your delight.
  Babies can focus on and start to track caregivers and objects/toys.
  They may start to coo and take turns "talking".
  Your baby prefers you over any toy/object.
- Babies at this age are learning how to self soothe by sucking on a pacifier or a finger.
  They are able to practice being on their tummy while looking at you, a mirror, or a toy.
- Your baby may also express their personality by showing preferences for toys, activities, and what schedule works for them.
- Acknowledge your baby's preferences so they feel understood.
  Recognize when they are alert and ready to play.
  If they are crying, turning away, and arching, your baby is signaling you to slow down or provide comfort.
  Being warm and affectionate may seem easy when your baby is happy, but it is also important to provide responsive and loving care when they are fussy and crying.
  This lets your baby know they are loved, understood, and not alone.
- Everyday interactions like feeding, dressing, and diaper changing are opportunities to share loving and caring messages with your baby.
  By providing responsive and nurturing care, you are not "spoiling" them.
- Face-to-face interaction with caregivers and avoiding screen time, except for live video chatting with loved ones, will enhance your child's social and verbal development.

## Nutrition
- Use breast milk and formula only.
- Give Vitamin D (400 IU/day) to babies receiving break milk.
- You are learning your baby's signals (sounds, facial expressions, and baby movements) to know when you're hungry or full.
- Feeding can be an opportunity to cuddle, talk to, and enjoy your baby.
- Spitting up is common.
  Keeping your baby upright after feeds can help.
  Ask your doctor if you have concerns about associated pain, choking, or feeding problems.

## Sleep
- Consider starting simple, calming routines to help your baby prepare for bedtime.
  It can be helpful to recognize signs that your baby is getting tired in order to know when to slow down and start your sleep routine.
- Some babies at this age are able to learn how to fall asleep after being put down when drowsy, but not fully asleep.
- You can help your baby sleep at night by not waking them to feed and by keeping the room dark and quite.

## Safety
- Put your baby to sleep on their back.
  Sleep positioners are not safe for babies.
- Install the car seat in backseat, rear-facing.
- Check to make sure smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are working.
- Avoid smoke/tobacco/cigarette/vaping liquid or smoke/marijuana exposure.
- Avoid hot liquids around your baby and set your water temperature < 120 F (48.9 C) to prevent accidental burns.
- Avoid strings or necklaces around the neck as they can choke a baby.
- A baby can roll or fall off of a high surface.
  Keep a hand on him when changing clothes and/or diapers.
- Babies need constant supervision when bathing.
- **Never shake your baby.**
  When you are feeling overwhelmed, take a break and ask for help.
