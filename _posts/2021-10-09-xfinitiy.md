I noticed the following statement when I was renewing my current xfinity internet plan.

> Includes our xFI Gateway and all the benefits of xFi, plus  
> **Unlimited data** ($30/mo value) for peace of mind  
> The best WiFi coverage throughout your home, with an xFi Pod included if recommended

Hmm... After doing some research online, I found the evidence from my xfinity account usage page that the **default internet monthly quota is 1.2TB**, as shown in the following image.

> You have 1 courtesy month to exceed 1229GB of usage without charge.  
> After using 1 courtesy month, if you exceed the plan you will be charged <span>$</span>10.00 for each 50GB of additional data provided, but charges will not exceed <span>$</span>100 each month, no matter how much you use. You can also purchase our unlimited data option.

Not too bad. But still, <span>$</span>10.00 for each 50GB of additional data provided seems just too high, even with the <span>$</span>100.0 additional dollar cap. So be mindful...
